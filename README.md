# BI_Task1_Wine-Quality-Predictionn
In this wine quality prediction machine learning project, we utilize linear regression to model the relationship between various chemical attributes of wines and their quality scores. By training the model on a labeled dataset of wine samples, we aim to predict the quality of new wines based on their chemical composition.
